# Detecting-credit-card-fraud-with-machine-learning

Financial institutions and payment operators are increasingly relying on machine learning algorithms to develop efficient and
effective fraud detection systems. The main aim is to implement and assess the performance of various machine learning models, 
including logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks, etc. 
A key challenge with payments fraud data is class imbalance. Class imbalance can make it difficult for standard models
to learn to distinguish between the majority and minority classes. Due to privacy concerns, it is not possible to infer
meaningful relationships between most of the variables in the dataset.
The main aim of the project would be to come with best predictive model rather than inference model.
